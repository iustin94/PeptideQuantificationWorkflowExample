Peptide Spectrum Matching SummaryProtein(s)	Protein(s) to which the peptide can be attached.
Position	Position of the peptide in the protein sequence(s).
AAs Before	The amino acids before the sequence.
Sequence	The identified sequence of amino acids.
AAs After	The amino acids after the sequence.
Modified Sequence	The amino acids sequence annotated with variable modifications.
Fixed Modifications	The fixed modifications.
Variable Modifications	The variable modifications.
D-score	D-score for variable PTM localization.
Probabilistic PTM score	The probabilistic score (e.g. A-score or PhosphoRS) used for variable PTM localization.
Localization Confidence	The confidence in variable PTM localization.
Spectrum File	The spectrum file.
Spectrum Title	The title of the spectrum.
Spectrum Scan Number	The spectrum scan number.
RT	Retention time as provided in the spectrum file.
m/z	Measured m/z.
Measured Charge	The charge as given in the spectrum file.
Identification Charge	The charge as inferred by the search engine.
Theoretical Mass	The theoretical mass of the peptide.
Isotope Number	The isotope number targetted by the instrument.
Precursor m/z Error [ppm]	The precursor m/z matching error in ppm.
Confidence [%]	Confidence in percent associated to the retained PSM.
Validation	Indicates the validation level of the retained PSM.
